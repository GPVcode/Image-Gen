## Search Image Application

#### I am practicing my vanilla JavaScript skills by creating a search images app that generates images based on user search queries. I will utilize the Unsplash API to generate the images. 


Process:
First, I spent time making the system design for the app's layout and structure.
Next, I set up HTML boiler plate and used CSS to set up initial layouts using dummy data as placeholders.
Then I set up API calls from my script file.
After successfully getting image data back from Unsplash, I finetuned the app to my liking with CSS.
