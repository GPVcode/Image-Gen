## Search Image Application

#### I am practicing my vanilla JavaScript skills by creating a search images app that generates images based on user search queries. I will utilize the Unsplash API to generate the images. 


**Process:**
- First, I spent time making the system design for the app's layout and structure.
- Next, I set up HTML boiler plate and used CSS to set up initial layouts using dummy data as placeholders.
- Then I set up API calls from my script file.
- After successfully getting image data back from Unsplash, I finetuned the app to my liking with CSS.

**Note**
For practice, I used CSS for majority of the application except for the "show more" button. As you'll see in the code, I used strictly JavaScript to design the button and implement hover feature.
